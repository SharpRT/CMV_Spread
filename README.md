# CMV_Spread
This code was written to describe the epidemiology of Cassava Mosaic Virus (CMV).
An epidemiological model was developed to model the spread and control of a CMV strain under two scenarios:
	(i) where it invades a region in which another CMV strain is endemic and must compete with it; and
	(ii) a region previously unaffected by CMV.

Two programs are provided here: 
	(i) "Analytical Model.mw" which was executed using Maple 17, produces the analytical results. 
		A text file version is also provided for users without access to Maple.
	(ii) The other files are code produced using MATLAB (2018b). 
		This performs a numerical simulation of the model. 
		These files are readable by standard text editors.

We also provide a copy of the data produced from these models that were used in this publication.
